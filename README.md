# Emitters

Allows placing devices that can be configured to emit any type of particle ("dust"), "gore", or sound effect. Rate, volume, size, direction, color, type, etc. can all be configured per emitter.

NEW (v1.2): Now featuring holograms! Use these to draw game sprites in any size, color, orientation, or type. Holograms may be animated, adapt to ambient light, or feature cool special effects.
